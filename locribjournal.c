/* locrib journal
 *
 * log locrib changes unti they are actioned by the output chain
 * a simple wrap-around buffer of address refernces
 * the producer writes an entry and increments the write cursor
 * the consumer, when the read cursor is behind the write cursor,
 * reads values from the current read cursor and increments it
 * the cursors wrap around when the reach the buffer limit
 * the buffer should be at most the allowed max size of the RIB
 * logic elsewhere guarantees that duplicate entries can not be pushed
 * the consumer re-enables updates for an address as it reads the current locrib.
 * The atomic operation is required for the locrib update only....
